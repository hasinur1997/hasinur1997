# About Me
I am Hasinur Rahman. Currently, I am working on [Arraytics](https://arraytics.com) as a Senior Software Engineer.

Around 6 years I have been working on Web Application development. Most of the time I use **WordPress**, **Laravel**, **React**, **Vue**, **PHP**, **MySQL**, and many more recent trends in technology to build web applications.

I always try to write **Unit Testing** for my code.

To maintain version control for my applications I use **Git**

**Docker** is an interesting and powerful tool to share web applications with others. There is no hassle to run any application in any other environment.

I have strong knowledge of Data structures and algorithms. I practice programming problem-solving using **python** on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/hasinur/) and [hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com/hasinur1997).

I have some hobbies as well. I like to cook food and travel somewhere.

I use some social applications. You can follow on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/hasinur1997), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hasinur1997) and [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/hasinur1997)
